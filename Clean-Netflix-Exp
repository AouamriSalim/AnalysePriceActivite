This Python code performs data analysis and visualization on a dataset related to Netflix content using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Import Libraries:
pandas is imported as pd.
matplotlib.pyplot is imported as plt.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Load Data:
The CSV file "netflix_data.csv" is loaded into a DataFrame named netflix_dataframe.
The first five rows of the DataFrame are printed using head().
python
Copy code
netflix_dataframe = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")
print(netflix_dataframe.head())
Filter Data:
Rows with TV shows are filtered out, and the resulting DataFrame is named netflix_subset.
python
Copy code
netflix_subset = netflix_dataframe[netflix_dataframe['type'] == 'Movie']
Select Columns:
A new DataFrame named netflix_movies is created, containing specific columns - "title," "country," "genre," "release_year," and "duration."
python
Copy code
netflix_movies = netflix_subset[["title", "country", "genre", "release_year", "duration"]]
Filter Short Movies:
Movies with a duration less than 60 minutes are filtered, and the result is stored in the short_movies DataFrame.
The first five rows of short_movies are printed.
python
Copy code
short_movies = netflix_movies[netflix_movies["duration"] < 60]
print(short_movies.head())
Assign Colors Based on Genres:
Colors are assigned to each movie based on its genre. The colors are stored in the list colors by iterating through the rows of netflix_movies.
python
Copy code
colors = []
for index, row in netflix_movies.iterrows():
    # Assign colors based on genre
    if row["genre"] == "Children":
        colors.append("blue")
    elif row["genre"] == "Documentaries":
        colors.append("green")
    elif row["genre"] == "Stand-Up":
        colors.append("red")
    else:
        colors.append("grey")
Create Scatter Plot:
A scatter plot is created using Matplotlib, with the x-axis representing the release year and the y-axis representing the duration of movies.
Colors are assigned based on the genres of movies.
python
Copy code
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(netflix_movies["release_year"], netflix_movies["duration"], c=colors)
Set Plot Labels and Title:
X-axis label is set to 'Release year'.
Y-axis label is set to 'Duration (min)'.
The plot title is set to 'Movie Duration by Year of Release'.
python
Copy code
ax.set_xlabel('Release year')
ax.set_ylabel('Duration (min)')
ax.set_title('Movie Duration by Year of Release')
Display Plot:
Finally, the plot is displayed using plt.show().
python
Copy code
plt.show()
This code essentially explores and visualizes the duration of movies released on Netflix over the years, distinguishing them by genres and highlighting movies with a duration less than 60 minutes.
